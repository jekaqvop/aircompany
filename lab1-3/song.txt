I wanna start by letting you know this
Because of you my life has a purpose
You helped me be who I am today
I see myself in every word you say
Sometimes it feels like nobody gets me
Trapped in a world where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you
I was broken
I was choking
I was lost, this song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died, this song saved my life
I was down
I was drowning
But it came on just in time, this song saved my life
Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in this small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's okay to be myself
I was broken
I was choking
I was lost, this song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died, this song saved my life
I was down
I was drowning
But it came on just in time, this song saved my life
You'll never know what it means to me
That I'm not alone, that I'll never have to be
I was broken
I was chocking
I was lost, this song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died, this song saved my life
I was down
I was drowning
But it came on just in time, this song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
